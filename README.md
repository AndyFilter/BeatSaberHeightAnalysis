Run the python script called **BeatSaberHeightBeatLeader.py**. (*python BeatSaberHeightBeatLeader.py*)

Next you will be asked to enter the Map Id, to get the Map Id all you have to do is:
- Go to [BeatLeader](https://www.beatleader.xyz/leaderboards)
- Find a map that you are interested in, and click on it
- The Map Id is the few characters at the end of the URL, just like on this image:

- Paste the Id into the console, press enter and voil√†. Now you have to wait up to few minutes (depends on your pc specs and internet bandwidth)
- After some time has passed, a graph with all the data should pop up.


# Sample Graphs
#### There are provided 2 additional sample files that the script uses, if you choose the correct Map Id.

# My Thoughts
Though the data looks cool and all, it's **very inconclusive**, which is probably caused by a marginal difference in peoples' height and the fact that you can **manually set the height** yourself in beatsaber settings.

# Note
Like I have mentioned earlier, you can manually adjust the height yourself. This causes some rather interesing numbers like **players** that are more that **3 meters tall, or that are shorter than a toddler**. To *combat* this I just added a code to filter out those values, you can find it [here](https://github.com/AndyFilter/BeatSaberHeightAnalysis/blob/9dbc7900f486baeabe7840dafd4bfed25f423c3c/BeatSaberHeightBeatLeader.py#L178). *The values were picked arbitrarily.* It's also *interesing* to run the code without this filter.

# Requirements
- Python 3.10 (I couldn't install Matplotlib on older versions)
